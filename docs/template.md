# `nixpkgs-lor`

Personal Nix package collection.

## About

This is a personal collection of Nix packages that I will pull (or have pulled)
to [`nixpkgs`][nixpkgs].
I use this Flake to install packages to my environments
until they are available on `nixpkgs` or until they are properly packaged.

[nixpkgs]: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs

## Package list

## Installation

The flake provides an overlay through which
you can install the packages in your environments.

```nix
pkgs = import nixpkgs {
  inherit system;
  overlays = [
    nixpkgs-lor.overlays.default.${system}
  ];
};
```
